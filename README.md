# Network Path

## Introduction 
This path will cover two main parts regarding networks from software developer perspective.  The main network concepts and how we could use these concepts in our development journey.

> This path is divided into resource stack that will cover the main concepts related to the path itself, and project stack which helps validate your understanding of these concepts.


## Objectives
By the end of this path you will be able to:
- Understand the difference between IP Address and Host Name. 
- Understand the difference between URL and URI.
- Use network concepts to build robust applications. 
- Build applications that communicate with other applications.
